EARTH SOUND MACHINE
===================

This is an experiment on HTML5 technologies, it uses only JS technology for creating a generative experience created by the earthquakes from a day. It produces a melody based on the magnitud of the earthquakes and displays its location.

It uses [Audiolet](https://github.com/oampo/Audiolet) audio synth JS library and [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) 3D JS plugin.

We also experimented with different ways to simulate Classes on JS, although I think the best option is [CS](http://coffeescript.org/), and will latter migrate everything.

Next goals:

* Represent the location in the spinning globe.
* Add a rhythm base to the sounds based on the depth that the quake was registered.
* Add ambient sounds based on the location of the event.
* Better performance
* Add interaction
